      <p>My Nona came over on the boat and would make "S" cookies often, they were my favorite! During Easter she would make them into a basket or rabbit and put a hardboiled egg in the center. I unfortunatly don't have her recipe so have been searching for something similar and came across Sicilian Orange Drop Cookies.</p>
